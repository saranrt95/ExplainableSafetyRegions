This repository contains data and code associated to the paper _Narteni S., Carlevaro A., Guzzi J., Mongelli M. (2024) "Ensuring Safe Social Navigation via Explainable Probabilistic and Conformal Safety Regions". The 2nd World Conference on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI-2024). La Valletta (Malta),17-19 July 2024._

The paper deals with simulated social robotics navigation problem that involves a fleet of mobile agents moving in a Cross scenario, governed by a human-
like behavior. With the purpose of avoiding collisions among them, we show how safe and explainable AI (XAI) methods can constitute useful tools to tailor the parameters of the behavior towards a safe, collision-free, navigation. 
The overall flowchart is depicted below:
